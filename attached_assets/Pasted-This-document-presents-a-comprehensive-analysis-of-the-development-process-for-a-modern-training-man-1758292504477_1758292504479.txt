Development Pattern Analysis
Architectural Approach
The development followed a structured pattern that demonstrates enterprise-level planning:
1. Foundation-First Strategy
Core infrastructure established before features
Authentication and authorization as prerequisites
Design system and component library as foundation
2. Incremental Module Development
Each business domain built as independent module
Clear separation of concerns
Reusable components across modules
3. Dependency-Aware Progression
Simple modules (Dashboard) before complex ones (Quizzes)
Core functionality before advanced features
Basic UI before real-time collaboration
4. Polish-Last Methodology
Performance optimization after functionality
Themes and accessibility as refinements
Developer tools and monitoring last
